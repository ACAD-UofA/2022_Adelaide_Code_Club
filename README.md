# Adelaide Code Club    ʕ •ᴥ•ʔ

A fortnightly datascience and R training club hosted by Raphael Eisenhofer and Olivia Johnson. Data generation in biology is only going to get bigger, so it's highly advantageous to learn how to manipulate data in a clean and reproducibile manner (not in Microsoft Excel!). These skills will be a huge boon to your candidature and beyond -- as they are highly sought after both in academnia and in industry. 

## Who is this code club for?
Everyone. Even if you've not opened a terminal before! If you're a seasoned coder, there's always room to improve and learn new functions.
