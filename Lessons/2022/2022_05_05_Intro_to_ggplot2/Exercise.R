##  INTRO TO GGPLOT2 EXERCISES  ##

## Shortcut Reminder:
  # ctrl + enter (or cmnd + enter) to run the line of code your cursor is currently on
  # 'tab' to autocomplete, arrow up and down through the options

## Setting up your workspace
  
  ## load libraries (By loading 'tidyverse', a number of tidyverse packages will be loaded including ggplot2 (listed in console). 
                   # However, you will need to load janitor and readxl separately.)

## Import our dataset and clean it up! 
  #(Reminder: you need to fix column names, empty rows, redundant columns and rows, NAs, species values, and the data type of variables)#




## Now that our data is clean, lets get plotting!!

## Create a scatter plot of sepal_length x sepal_width


  ## colour points by species


  ## separate plot into facets


  ## add in linear trend line


  ## clean up labels


  ## remove redundant labels


## Create a plot showing the distribution of petal width for each species, remember to tidy your axes.




## Practise saving your plots
