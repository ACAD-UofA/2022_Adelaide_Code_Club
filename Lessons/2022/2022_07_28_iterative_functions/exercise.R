## Iterative functions ##

## Shortcut Reminder:
# ctrl + enter (or cmnd + enter) to run the line of code your cursor is currently on
# 'tab' to autocomplete, arrow up and down through the options

## for loops
  # create a vector of values 1 to 10


  # create for loop to print out each value


  # create a for loop to only print out values divisible by 2


  # create another vector of values ranging 1 to 5


  # create a for loop that multiplies values from the two vectors and prints those divisible by 3



## apply functions

df <- data.frame(x = 1:4, y = 25:38, z=89:92)


  # create a vector of the mean of each row of df


  # apply the function sqrt() to all values in the vector


  # create code that will print "The square root of [value] is [square root of value]." 
  # using the values obtained using the apply functions
