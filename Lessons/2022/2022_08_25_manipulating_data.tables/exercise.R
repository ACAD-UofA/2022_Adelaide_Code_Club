## read in air quality data


## subset the data from the month of June


## calculate the mean of the Temp


## subset all rows where temp is over the mean


## add a column to the DT containing the temp in degrees celcius. F to C = (temp in F − 32) × 5/9


## add two more columns, 1. an identifier of both the date and time and 2. the temperature in K (C to K = temp in C + 273.15)


## check that Temp is the dame data type as the other temperature values and change it if it isn't


## reassign column name to make the temp in F clear


## remove the Ozone, Solar.R and Wind columns 


## extract the mean, median, min, and max of the temperature in C
