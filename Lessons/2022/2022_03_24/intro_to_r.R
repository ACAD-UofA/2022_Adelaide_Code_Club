## Intro to R and RStudio exercise

## to execute code from an R script use cmd + enter (mac) or ctrl + enter (windows)

## Execute the below line of code and use this vector to answer the following questions. 

vec = c(51, 16, 61, 15, 51, 16, 54, 98, 41, 80)

## Under each question, write the code the produces the answer, you do not need to write the answers in this script.

  ## Q1. What is the length of the vector?


  ## Q2. What is the min, max, and mean of the vector?


  ## Q3. Extract the fourth element of the vector and replace it with a number of your choosing.


  ## Q4. What is the total of elements in vec?


  ## Q5. Reorder the vec into ascending order. Hint: you will need to use the sort() function, look this up to see how to use it.


vec.2 <- c("hello", "there")    ## Use this vector to answer the following questions


  ## Q6. Are vec and vec.2 the same type? Use functions and operations to get a TRUE/FALSE answer.



## Run the whole script to check the answers print out in the console. Use cmd + shift + enter (mac) or ctrl + shift + enter (windows)
